        <p> South Bronx residents on Sunday welcomed the immigrant-rights theater project Little Amal “walking” into the Waterfront Park.

Sponsors and supporters waved blue banners and cheered as they hoisted the <a href=https://www.walkwithamal.org/target=_blank>10–foot Little Amal.</a> The giant-size puppet is based on a Syrian refugee child seeking social, economic and environmental justice.

            <p>“Little Amal is raising the voice of displaced people,” said<a href=https://www.instagram.com/yazmany/?hl=entarget=_blank> Yazamny Arboleda</a>, one of the artists behind the New York Stop on Little Amal’s World Tour. “South Bronx is the community of migrants and refugees,” he said. Arboleda points out to the new apartment buildings in South Bronx “It’s complicated because when you see the situation and the development, why not prioritize the values and lives of the residents of the community? For little Amal, it is a priority to understand and make the world see these realities from the heart.”

            <p>Several hundred people gathered to see Little Amal. They were happy and excited. “It is a great event for kids,” said Emma, 40, who just gave her first name. “They can learn and remember about the migrants as I am one of them,” said Emma who came from Long Island. “The puppet shows there is no border and it shouldn’t be. We are all human and equal. It is just a name they called immigrants.” </p>

            <p>The new H.E. Arts community center and Korean Art Forum held the event to talk about migration. The center provided an information desk in the fields of health, education, and the arts within the Mott Haven-Port Morris district in the South Bronx. Korea Art Forum announced a new project. A big banner created for the Mott Haven project that captures the diversity of the residents of Mott Haven by photographically focusing on their eyes is displayed there. </p>

        <p> <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/heng-gil-han-2b16634hl=entarget=_blank> Heng-Gil Han </a> the organizer of the Korean Art Forum said “This program has connected immigrant communities and underserved ethnic enclaves in NYC to visual arts and culture through access and participatory art activities. Our goal is to fight against inequity in the art field. We try to bring together all people from the art world to share dialogues and support inclusion, diversity, equity, and accessibility.”

        Recently thousands of migrants were sent from Texas to NYC in the south Bronx and entered homeless shelters. “South Bronx is the place of migrants,” said <a href=https://www.southbronxunite.org/our-board#:~:text=Mychal%20Johnson&text=Mychal%20is%20a%20community%2Dbased,is%20also%20a%20board%20member.shl=entarget=_blank>Mychal Johnson</a> the founder of South Bronx Unite. He said “we are opening our arms to the people across the border. Walking of Little Amal from the political point of view will bring attention to the migrant and justice that we fight for.”
